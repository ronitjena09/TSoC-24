    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">My Journey</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700">I started my journey in Web Development since 2022, starting from Basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Then I dived into the world of frameworks in 2023, where I started learning <b>React.js, Next.js, Blockchain basics</b>, etc. Started learning Data Structures and Algoriths in 2021, using Java as the programming language. As I used Javaas the preffered language, I dived deep into the Core as well as advanced Java such as <b>Spring, Spring Boot, Maven</b>.  </p>
    <p>Thank You!</p>
